\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Quantum information theory aims to harness the behavior of quantum mechanical
objects to store, transfer and process information~\cite{hayashi}. This behavior
is in many cases very different from the one we observe in classical world.
Quantum algorithms and protocols take advantage of superposition of states and
require the presence of entangled states. Both phenomena arise from the rich
structure of the space of quantum states. Hence, to explore the capabilities of
quantum information processing, one needs to fully understand this
space~\cite{BZ06}. 

Quantum mechanics provides us also with much larger than in classical case space
of allowed operations which can be used to manipulate quantum
states~\cite{hayashi,BZ06}. Recent results concerning additivity
problems~\cite{hastings09superadditivity} show that we are far from full
understanding the nature of quantum channels. Exploring the space of quantum
operations is fascinating, but cumbersome task.

%One of the motivations behind quantum information theory was an observation that
%the simulation of quantum systems on classical machine requires exponential 
%resources.

We present a~package of functions developed for \Mathematica\ 7.0 which aims to
simplify the analysis of quantum states and quantum operations. The package was 
developed in simplicity in mind and thus it uses only basic data structures
available in \Mathematica. This allows to relatively easily port implemented
functions to other scientific software systems. Also, in contrast to most
quantum computing packages available~\cite{qdensity,qucalc,quantum2}, \qi\ is
not aimed to provide tool for simulating quantum algorithms and protocols. We
rather focus on the analysis of quantum states used in those protocols and
quantum channels, which are used to describe allowed physical operations. The
main goal of presented package is to provide basic mathematical tools useful for
studding quantum stats and quantum channels.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:qi-intro} we review
basic notion of quantum density matrices and quantum channels representing
allowed physical transformations of density matrices. Section~\ref{sec:over}
presents an overview of functionality provided by \qi\ package and describes
some operations used as building blocks in specialized functions.
Sections~\ref{sec:states} and \ref{sec:channels} provide detailed description of
functions implemented in~\qi. Finally Section~\ref{sec:comclude} provides some
concluding remarks.

\section{Quantum states and operations}\label{sec:qi-intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $\HS{H}$ be a~separable, complex Hilbert space used to described the system
in question. In quantum information theory we deal mainly with
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, so usually we have to are in situation where
$\HS{H}=\Cplx^n$. State of the system is described by the density matrix, \ie\
operator $\rho:\HS{H}\rightarrow\HS{H}$, which is positive ($\rho\geq0$) and
normalized ($\tr{\rho}=1$).

\subsection{Design principles}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newcounter{principle}
\begin{list}{\textbf{P\arabic{principle}}}{\usecounter{principle}}
\item Functions are as simple as possible -- functions have minimum reasonable
number of arguments and implement small pieces of functionality. For example in
order to get partial trace on few subsystems user needs to perform permutation
and then apply partial trace 
\item User knows what she is doing -- functions implemented in \qi\ do not
validate the input and user is expected to provide reasonable data.
\item Only basic \Mathematica\ structures are used -- functions operator on
plain \Mathematica\ lists and return lists.
\item Some data are used more often then other -- \qi\ predefines some commonly
used matrices, for example matrices for \SWAP\ operation and Pauli matrices for
small dimensions.

\subsection{Partial operations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\qi\ implements partial operations using general method for constructing
channels acting on subsystems. This method is based on formula
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:def-tensor}
(\Phi\otimes\Id)(\rho) = 
\left(\res^{-1}\left(M_\Phi\res\left(\rho^R\right)\right)\right)^R
\end{equation}
where ${}^R$ denotes the reshuffling operation and $M_\Phi$ denotes the matrix
of the linear map $\Phi$
\begin{equation}
M_\Phi = \tr \epsilon_i \Phi(\epsilon_j),
\end{equation}
where $\{\epsilon_i\}_i=1,\ldots,n^2$ is a canonical basis in $\M_n$. In the 
Eq.~\ref{eqn:def-tensor} operation $\Phi$ is applied to the first subsystem 
only.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Partial transposition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the case of transposition $M_\Phi$ is equivalent to \SWAP. For example in the
case of $4$-dimensional density matrix
\begin{equation}
X=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 \alpha_{1,1} & \alpha_{1,2} & \alpha_{1,3} & \alpha_{1,4} \\
 \alpha_{2,1} & \alpha_{2,2} & \alpha_{2,3} & \alpha_{2,4} \\
 \alpha_{3,1} & \alpha_{3,2} & \alpha_{3,3} & \alpha_{3,4} \\
 \alpha_{4,1} & \alpha_{4,2} & \alpha_{4,3} & \alpha_{4,4}
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
partial transposition with respect to second subsystems is obtained using
\code{PartialTransposeB[X, 2, 2]} and it gives
\begin{equation}
X^{T_B}=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 \alpha_{1,1} & \alpha_{2,1} & \alpha_{1,3} & \alpha_{2,3} \\
 \alpha_{1,2} & \alpha_{2,2} & \alpha_{1,4} & \alpha_{2,4} \\
 \alpha_{3,1} & \alpha_{4,1} & \alpha_{3,3} & \alpha_{4,3} \\
 \alpha_{3,2} & \alpha_{4,2} & \alpha_{3,4} & \alpha_{4,4}
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Partial trace}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Operation of tracing out a subsystem can be achieved in a similar manner. We 
define tracing map as
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\mathrm{tr}(\rho) = \tr \rho \Id,
\end{equation}
which for gives
\begin{equation}
D_{\Phi_\mathrm{tr}} =
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
for one qubit. Note that this matrix after reshuffling is equal to $\Id$ and 
thus $\Phi_\tr$ is CP-TP map.
