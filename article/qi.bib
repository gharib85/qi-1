  abstract={Methods of constructing random matrices typical of circular unitary 
and circular orthogonal ensembles are presented. We generate numerically 
random unitary matrices and show that the statistical properties of their 
spectra (level-spacing distribution, number variance) and eigenvectors 
(entropy, participation ratio, eigenvector statistics) confer to the 
predictions of the random-matrix theory, for both CUE and COE.}
