In this section we present Schmidt decomposition for vectors and operators
on bipartite Hilbert space.

\paragraph{Vector Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Schmidt-Decomposition}
For a given vector  $\ket{\psi} \in \Hilb{K}\otimes \Hilb{M}$,
let $\Psi \in \Lin(\Hilb{M},\Hilb{K})$, such that $\res(\Psi) = \ket{\psi}$.
There exists a decomposition
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi} = 
 \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} \ket{U(i)} \otimes \overline{\ket{V(i)}},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\Psi$,
 \item $\ket{U(i)}$ is eigenvector of
$\Psi\Psi^{\dagger}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$,
 \item $\ket{V(i)}$ is eigenvector of 
$\Psi^{\dagger} \Psi$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform Schmidt decomposition on a vector $\psi \in \Hilb{K}\otimes
\Hilb{M}$ in package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}}[ \psi, \{K,M\}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted.
See the function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

\paragraph{Operator Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Operator-Schmidt-Decomposition}
Let $A \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$,
then there exists decomposition
\begin{equation}
 A = \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} U(i) \otimes \overline{V(i)},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\reshuffle{A}$,
 \item $U(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}, \Hilb{n_1})$, such that $\res(U(i))$ is eigenvector of $\reshuffle{A} (\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$,
\item $V(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_2}, \Hilb{n_2})$, such that $\res(V(i))$ is eigenvector of $(\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger} \reshuffle{A}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform operator Schmidt decomposition on an operator $A \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$ 
in the package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}}[ A, \{... , ... \}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when ...... $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted.
See the function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

%Let $A \in M_{n_1 n_2,m_1 m_2}$. 
%If we write singular value decomposition (see Theorem \ref{th:SVD})for reshuffled matrix $A$, we get
%\begin{equation}
% A^{R} = \sum \sigma_i \ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)}.
%\end{equation}
%Because $(A^{R})^{R} = A$ we get
%\begin{equation}
% A = (A^{R})^{R} = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R.
%\end{equation}
%Now we use our previous result concerning reshuffling of rank 1 partial isometries 
%Eqn. (\ref{Eqn:Reshuffling-for-rank1-partial-isometry}) and obtain 
%\begin{equation}
% A = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R =
% \sum \sigma_i \res^{-1}(\ket{U(i)}) \otimes \res^{-1}(\ket{V(i)})^{\star}
%\end{equation}
