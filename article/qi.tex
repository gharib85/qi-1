\subsubsection{Symbolic matrices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The power of \Mathematica{} lies in its ability to operate on symbolic objects.
To facilitate work with \qi{} the package there are several functions that 
return various types of symbolic matrices.

Function $\fname{SymbolicMatrix}[a,d]$ returns $d$-dimensional square matrix 
$\{a_{ij}\}$, the same function called with three parameters 
$\fname{SymbolicMatrix}[a,d_1,d_2]$ returns $d_1 \times d_2$-dimensional 
matrix $\{a_{ij}\}$. Accordingly one can call function 
$\fname{SymbolicVector}[a,d]$ to obtain $d$-dimensional vector $(a_i)$.
A~$d$-dimensional Hermitian matrix can be obtained using function 
$\fname{SymbolicHermitianMatrix}[a,d]$. 

For example a call to $\fname{SymbolicHermitianMatrix}[a,3]$ gives the 
following result
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 a_{1,1} & \left(a_{2,1}\right){}^* & \left(a_{3,1}\right){}^* \\
 a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \left(a_{3,2}\right){}^* \\
 a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3} \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}

%And a~bistochastic matrix using function
%$\fname{SymbolicBistochasticMatrix}[a, d]$.

\subsubsection{Schmidt decomposition (ZP)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we present Schmidt decomposition for vectors and operators
on bipartite Hilbert space.

\paragraph{Vector Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Schmidt-Decomposition}
For a given vector  $\ket{\psi} \in \Hilb{K}\otimes \Hilb{M}$,
let $\Psi \in \Lin(\Hilb{M},\Hilb{K})$, such that $\res(\Psi) = \ket{\psi}$.
There exists a decomposition
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi} = 
 \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} \ket{U(i)} \otimes \overline{\ket{V(i)}},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\Psi$,
 \item $\ket{U(i)}$ is eigenvector of
$\Psi\Psi^{\dagger}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$,
 \item $\ket{V(i)}$ is eigenvector of 
$\Psi^{\dagger} \Psi$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform Schmidt decomposition on a vector $\psi \in \Hilb{K}\otimes
\Hilb{M}$ in package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}}[ \psi, \{K,M\}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted.
See the function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

\paragraph{Operator Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Operator-Schmidt-Decomposition}
Let $A \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$,
then there exists decomposition
\begin{equation}
 A = \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} U(i) \otimes \overline{V(i)},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\reshuffle{A}$,
 \item $U(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}, \Hilb{n_1})$, such that $\res(U(i))$ is eigenvector of $\reshuffle{A} (\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$,
\item $V(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_2}, \Hilb{n_2})$, such that $\res(V(i))$ is eigenvector of $(\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger} \reshuffle{A}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform operator Schmidt decomposition on an operator $A \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$ 
in the package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\fname{SchmidtDecomposition}[ A, \{... , ... \}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when ...... $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted.
See the function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

%Let $A \in M_{n_1 n_2,m_1 m_2}$. 
%If we write singular value decomposition (see Theorem \ref{th:SVD})for reshuffled matrix $A$, we get
%\begin{equation}
% A^{R} = \sum \sigma_i \ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)}.
%\end{equation}
%Because $(A^{R})^{R} = A$ we get
%\begin{equation}
% A = (A^{R})^{R} = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R.
%\end{equation}
%Now we use our previous result concerning reshuffling of rank 1 partial isometries 
%Eqn. (\ref{Eqn:Reshuffling-for-rank1-partial-isometry}) and obtain 
%\begin{equation}
% A = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R =
% \sum \sigma_i \res^{-1}(\ket{U(i)}) \otimes \res^{-1}(\ket{V(i)})^{\star}
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Partial trace and transposition (PG)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Partial trace}
Let $A\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots \otimes \Hilb{m_n})$,
the \emph{partial trace} of $A$ over subsystems indexed with indices 
$I=\{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\}\subset \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, where $k\leq n$, is 
operator $B\in \Lin(\bigotimes_{i\notin I} \Hilb{m_i})$, such that
$B=(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{op}(i))(A)$, where $\mathrm{op}(i)=\tr$ if 
$i\in I$ and $\mathrm{op}(i)=\1_{m_i}$ if $i\notin I$.

To perform the partial trace of an operator $A$, defined as above, in the 
package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
B=\fname{PartialTrace}[A, \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\}, \{i_1, i_2, 
\ldots, i_k\}].
\end{equation} 

\paragraph{Partial transpose}
Let $A\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots \otimes \Hilb{m_n})$,
the \emph{partial transpose} of $A$ with respect to subsystems indexed with 
indices $I=\{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\}\subset \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, where $k\leq 
n$, is the operator $B\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots 
\otimes \Hilb{m_n})$, such that $B=(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{op}(i))(A)$, 
where $\mathrm{op}(i)=\cdot^{\mathrm T}$ if $i\in I$ and 
$\mathrm{op}(i)=\1_{m_i}$ if $i\notin I$.

To perform the partial transpose of an operator $A$, defined as above, in the 
package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
B=\fname{PartialTranspose}[A, \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\}, \{i_1, i_2, 
\ldots, i_k\}].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Quantum states}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Parametrizations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\qi{} package provides several parametrizations of quantum states. 

\paragraph{Pure states}
Any pure $N$-dimensional quantum state vector can be parametrized by set of 
$2N-2$ parameters \cite{vedra98entanglement}: $N-1$ parameters $\{\phi_1, 
\ldots, 
\phi_{N-1}\}$ parametrize probability vector according to the following equation
\begin{equation}
p_i=\sin^2\phi_{i-1} \prod\limits_{j=i}^{N-1}\cos^2\phi_j\text{\ \ with 
}\phi_0=\pi/2,
\end{equation}
and further $N-1$ parameters $\{\theta_1, \ldots
\theta_{N-1}\}$ parametrize relative phases. The resulting pure state 
is of the form
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{p_0}\\
\sqrt{p_1}e^{\ii \theta_1}\\
\vdots\\
\sqrt{p_{N-1}}e^{\ii \theta_{N-1}}
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
This parametrization is implemented in \qi{} in function
$\fname{StateVector}[l]$ where $l=\{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_{N-1}, \theta_1, \ldots
\theta_{N-1}\}$.

\paragraph{Special unitary matrices}
$d$-dimensional special unitary matrix can be parametrized using 
$d-1$-parameters. In \qi{} function 
$\fname{SpecialUnitary}[d,\{l_1,\ldots,l_{d-1}\}]$ 
implements Euler angles parametrization introduced in 
\cite{zyczkowski94random}. Parameters $l_i$ are 
truncated so that they belong to the interval $l_i\in [0,1]$.
