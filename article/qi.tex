\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Quantum information theory aims to harness the behavior of quantum mechanical
objects to store, transfer and process information. This behavior is in many
cases very different from the one we observe in the classical world. Quantum
algorithms and protocols take advantage of superposition of states and require
the presence of entangled states. Both phenomena arise from the rich structure
of the space of quantum states. Hence, to explore the capabilities of quantum
information processing, one needs to fully understand this space~\cite{BZ06}.
Quantum mechanics provides us also with much larger than in classical case space
of allowed operations which can be used to manipulate quantum
states~\cite{BZ06}. Recent results concerning additivity
problems~\cite{hastings09superadditivity} show that we are far from full
understanding the nature of quantum channels. Exploring the space of quantum
operations is fascinating, but cumbersome task.

In this paper we present a~package of functions developed for \Mathematica\
computing system which aims to simplify the analysis of quantum states and
quantum operations. The package was developed in simplicity in mind and thus it
uses only basic data structures available in \Mathematica. This allows to
relatively easily port implemented functions to other scientific software
systems. Also, in contrast to most quantum computing packages
available~\cite{quantum2, qdensity, qcwave, qucalc}, \qi\ is not aimed at
providing tool for simulating quantum algorithms and protocols. We rather focus
on the analysis of quantum states used in those protocols and quantum channels,
which are used to describe allowed physical operations. The main goal of
presented package is to provide basic mathematical tools useful for studding
geometrical properties of quantum stats and quantum channels.

\subsection{Related work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

During the last several years many simulators of quantum computers have been
developed. The most up-to-date list of available software is hosted
at~\cite{quantiki-simulators}. A number of simulators of quantum
information processing was developed using \Mathematica\ computing
system~\cite{qucalc, qdensity, quantum2, miszczak12generating, qcwave}. 

\note{One sentence about each of the above mentioned}


%Also some attention has been devoted to utilising
%new programming \cite{gutierrez10cuda} and parallel processing
%model~\cite{glendinning03parallelization, deraedt07massively, tabakin09qcmpi}.
%The research effort in using parallel and distributed computing for the purpose
%of quantum information processing is motivarted by the amount of computation
%resource needed in order to perform a simulation of quantum computation.

\subsubsection{Symbolic matrices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The power of \Mathematica{} lies in its ability to operate on symbolic objects.
To facilitate work with \qi{} the package there are several functions that 
return various types of symbolic matrices.

Function $\fname{SymbolicMatrix}[a,d]$ returns $d$-dimensional square matrix 
$\{a_{ij}\}$, the same function called with three parameters 
$\fname{SymbolicMatrix}[a,d_1,d_2]$ returns $d_1 \times d_2$-dimensional 
matrix $\{a_{ij}\}$. Accordingly one can call function 
$\fname{SymbolicVector}[a,d]$ to obtain $d$-dimensional vector $(a_i)$.
A~$d$-dimensional Hermitian matrix can be obtained using function 
$\fname{SymbolicHermitianMatrix}[a,d]$. 

For example a call to $\fname{SymbolicHermitianMatrix}[a,3]$ gives the 
following result
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 a_{1,1} & a_{2,1}^* & a_{3,1}^* \\
 a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{3,2}^* \\
 a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3} \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}

%And a~bistochastic matrix using function
%$\fname{SymbolicBistochasticMatrix}[a, d]$.

\subsubsection{Schmidt decomposition (ZP)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we present Schmidt decomposition for vectors and operators on
bipartite Hilbert space.

\paragraph{Vector Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Schmidt-Decomposition}
For a given vector  $\ket{\psi} \in \Hilb{K}\otimes \Hilb{M}$,
let $\Psi \in \Lin(\Hilb{M},\Hilb{K})$, such that $\res(\Psi) = \ket{\psi}$.
There exists a decomposition
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi} = 
 \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} \ket{U(i)} \otimes \overline{\ket{V(i)}},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\Psi$,
 \item $\ket{U(i)}$ is eigenvector of
$\Psi\Psi^{\dagger}$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$,
 \item $\ket{V(i)}$ is eigenvector of 
$\Psi^{\dagger} \Psi$
 with the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform Schmidt decomposition on a vector $\psi \in \Hilb{K}\otimes \Hilb{M}$
in package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}}[ \psi, \{K,M\}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted. See the
function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

\paragraph{Operator Schmidt decomposition}
\begin{theorem} \label{th:Operator-Schmidt-Decomposition}
Let $A \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$,
then there exists decomposition
\begin{equation}
 A = \sum \sqrt{\lambda_i} U(i) \otimes \overline{V(i)},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ are singular values of matrix $\reshuffle{A}$,
    \item $U(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}, \Hilb{n_1})$, such that $\res(U(i))$ is
    eigenvector of $\reshuffle{A} (\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger}$ with the eigenvalue
    $\lambda_i$,
    \item $V(i) \in \Lin(\Hilb{m_2}, \Hilb{n_2})$, such that $\res(V(i))$ is
    eigenvector of $(\reshuffle{A})^{\dagger} \reshuffle{A}$ with the eigenvalue
    $\lambda_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

To perform operator Schmidt decomposition on an operator $A \in
\Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2},\Hilb{n_1}\otimes \Hilb{n_2})$ in the package
\qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
\fname{SchmidtDecomposition}[ A, \{... , ... \}]
\end{equation} 
in the case, when ...... $K=M$, the dimension specification can be omitted. See
the function list in the appendix for specification of the function
\texttt{SchmidtDecomposition}.

%Let $A \in M_{n_1 n_2,m_1 m_2}$. 
%If we write singular value decomposition (see Theorem \ref{th:SVD})for reshuffled matrix $A$, we get
%\begin{equation}
% A^{R} = \sum \sigma_i \ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)}.
%\end{equation}
%Because $(A^{R})^{R} = A$ we get
%\begin{equation}
% A = (A^{R})^{R} = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R.
%\end{equation}
%Now we use our previous result concerning reshuffling of rank 1 partial isometries 
%Eqn. (\ref{Eqn:Reshuffling-for-rank1-partial-isometry}) and obtain 
%\begin{equation}
% A = \sum \sigma_i (\ketbra{U(i)}{V(i)})^R =
% \sum \sigma_i \res^{-1}(\ket{U(i)}) \otimes \res^{-1}(\ket{V(i)})^{\star}
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Partial trace and transposition (PG)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Partial trace}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $A\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots \otimes \Hilb{m_n})$,
the \emph{partial trace} of $A$ over subsystems indexed with indices $I=\{i_1,
i_2, \ldots, i_k\}\subset \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, where $k\leq n$, is operator $B\in
\Lin(\bigotimes_{i\notin I} \Hilb{m_i})$, such that $B=(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}
\mathrm{op}(i))(A)$, where $\mathrm{op}(i)=\tr$ if $i\in I$ and
$\mathrm{op}(i)=\1_{m_i}$ if $i\notin I$.

To perform the partial trace of an operator $A$, defined as above, in the
package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
B=\fname{PartialTrace}[A, \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\}, \{i_1, i_2, 
\ldots, i_k\}].
\end{equation} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Partial transpose}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $A\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots \otimes \Hilb{m_n})$,
the \emph{partial transpose} of $A$ with respect to subsystems indexed with
indices $I=\{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\}\subset \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, where $k\leq n$,
is the operator $B\in \Lin(\Hilb{m_1}\otimes \Hilb{m_2}\otimes \ldots \otimes
\Hilb{m_n})$, such that $B=(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{op}(i))(A)$, where
$\mathrm{op}(i)=\cdot^{\mathrm T}$ if $i\in I$ and $\mathrm{op}(i)=\1_{m_i}$ if
$i\notin I$.

To perform the partial transpose of an operator $A$, defined as above, in the
package \qi{} one can call function
\begin{equation}
B=\fname{PartialTranspose}[A, \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\}, \{i_1, i_2, 
\ldots, i_k\}].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Geometric tools}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Distance measures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In \qi{} following distance measures between density matrices are implemented.

\paragraph{Trace distance} \ldots 

\begin{equation}
D_{\tr}(\rho_1,\rho_2)=\frac12\tr|\rho_1-\rho_2|
\end{equation}
In \qi{} the function $\fname{TraceDistance}[\rho_1,\rho_2]$ calculates the 
value of $D_{\tr}(\rho_1,\rho_2)$.

\paragraph{Fidelity}  \ldots
\begin{equation}
F(\rho_1,\rho_2)=
\left(\tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho_1}\rho_2\sqrt{\rho_1}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
In \qi{} the function $\fname{Fidelity}[\rho_1,\rho_2]$ calculates the 
value of $F(\rho_1,\rho_2)$.

\paragraph{Subfidelity}
Superfidelity is an lower bound on fidelity 
\cite{miszczak2008sup}
and is given by the following equation
\begin{equation}
E(\rho_1,\rho_2)=
\tr\rho_1\rho_2+\sqrt{2[(\tr\rho_1\rho_2)^2-\tr\rho_1\rho_2\rho_1\rho_2)]}
\end{equation}
In \qi{} the function $\fname{Subfidelity}[\rho_1,\rho_2]$ calculates the 
value of $E(\rho_1,\rho_2)$.

\paragraph{Superfidelity} Superfidelity is an upper bound on fidelity,
it is given by the following equation
\begin{equation}
G(\rho_1,\rho_2)=\tr\rho_1\rho_2+\sqrt{1-\tr\rho_1^2}\sqrt{1-\tr\rho_2^2}
\end{equation}
In \qi{} the function $\fname{Superfidelity}[\rho_1,\rho_2]$ calculates the 
value of $G(\rho_1,\rho_2)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quantum states}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Parametrizations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\qi{} package provides several parametrizations of quantum states. 

\paragraph{Pure states}
Any pure $N$-dimensional quantum state vector can be parametrized by set of 
$2N-2$ parameters \cite{vedra98entanglement}: $N-1$ parameters $\{\phi_1, 
\ldots, 
\phi_{N-1}\}$ parametrize probability vector according to the following equation
\begin{equation}
p_i=\sin^2\phi_{i-1} \prod\limits_{j=i}^{N-1}\cos^2\phi_j\text{\ \ with 
}\phi_0=\pi/2,
\end{equation}
and further $N-1$ parameters $\{\theta_1, \ldots
\theta_{N-1}\}$ parametrize relative phases. The resulting pure state 
is of the form
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{p_0}\\
\sqrt{p_1}e^{\ii \theta_1}\\
\vdots\\
\sqrt{p_{N-1}}e^{\ii \theta_{N-1}}
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
This parametrization is implemented in \qi{} in function
$\fname{StateVector}[l]$ where $l=\{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_{N-1}, \theta_1, \ldots
\theta_{N-1}\}$.

\paragraph{Special unitary matrices}
$d$-dimensional special unitary matrix can be parametrized using
$d-1$-parameters. In \qi{} function
$\fname{SpecialUnitary}[d,\{l_1,\ldots,l_{d-1}\}]$ implements Euler angles
parametrization introduced in \cite{zyczkowski94random}. Parameters $l_i$ are
truncated so that they belong to the interval $l_i\in [0,1]$.
